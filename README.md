My fullstack project
This is a very simple and small project which contains both Frontend and Backend;
i used Javascript language and css to style it.
with this application you can register yourself by input some info then
they will save in MongoDB as the data base ;
next time you can login easily by using username and password.
the application will check the data and if they exist in data base you will 
login successfully!
